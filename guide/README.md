## What's Custom Command Bot?
Custom Command bot is a bot allowing you to create completely customizable commands!
It's a perfect tool both for experienced developers, and complete beginners who are looking for a way of quick and easy bot development.

### How do custom commands work?
As the name suggests they are completely customizable. You are able to specify pretty much anything discord allows bot to do.
