## Triggertypes
 
Our Bot is highly customizable and supports many Discord Actions(events). Down below is a list of all triggertypes with their explanation.

::: tip What is a trigger?
A trigger executes a code when a condition is met. Like if you send !!help, it will trigger the help command, since the trigger is the same.
