# Using arrays
In this guide you will learn what arrays are, and how to use them.

## General info
Generally speaking, arrays are collections of elements arranged in order.

You can think of them as lines/queues containing multiple people(elements).

## Indexing
Indexes are used to differentiate elements in most array-related functions. 

Let's say we had an array of three people: **Bob**, **Adam**, and **Lucy**.

* **Bob**'s index is 1 
* **Adam**'s index is 2
* **Lucy**'s index is 3

Once you have an array, you can use a variety of functions to edit and get information from it.

## Using arrays
In Custom Command there are two main ways of creating an array. In this guide, we will cover both of them.

## 1. Text splitting
To use an array you first have to create one, the most popular way is with [$arrayCreate](../Text/Array/arrayCreate.md) function. 
It takes a certain text, and splits it by a separator (any text that separated the elements).

### Example
Let's say we have a text `apple, banana, orange`, and we want to turn it into an array.
As you can see, these names are separated by a comma `, `.

**$arrayCreate** doesn't return anything itself, we need a different function to check if it works.
To check if everything works properly, we will read the number of elements with [$arrayLength](../Text/Array/arrayLength.md).

```php
// Create an array of three elements
$arrayCreate[apple, banana, orange;, ]

// Get the first element
$arrayLength
```

Let's execute the code, and check how many elements have been created.

        3
    </discord-message>
</discord-messages>

As you can see, the number returned matches with the number of fruits we provided.

## 2. Pushing elements
You may not always want to create an array from a given text. 
In some cases, you may prefer to start building an array, by appending new elements to an empty one.

In order to do that, you can use the [$arrayPush](../Text/Array/arrayPush.md) function, which adds a new element to the end of the array.

Let's craft an array of a few different animals, and check what's the first and last one.

```php
// Push all thre elements
$arrayPush[Dog]
$arrayPush[Cat]
$arrayPush[Mouse]
$arrayPush[Elephant]

// Return the first and last elements
$arrayGet[1], $arrayGet[4]
```

Let's execute this code and see what it returns.

        Dog, Elephant
    </discord-message>
</discord-messages>

As you can array push has correctly registered separate animals.

## 3. Searching for values
As you may know, array functions mostly work based on element indexes. 
Generally, this kind of behavior is convenient, but we also need a way to get those indexes from existing arrays.

Here's how to use [$arraySearch](../Text/Array/arraySearch.md) to do just that.

Let's start off by creating a new array of a few staff members, and get `fajfaj`'s index.

```php
$arrayCreate[RAKE Oanretesue Mido fajfaj ThatKev; ]
fajfaj's index is `$arraySearch[fajfaj]`
```

Now, head back to discord, and let's check the output:

<discord-messages>
    <discord-message :bot=true author="Custom Command" role-color="#0099ff" avatar="https://media.discordapp.net/avatars/725721249652670555/781224f90c3b841ba5b40678e032f74a.webp">
        fajfaj's index is 4
    </discord-message>
</discord-messages>

## 4. Saving arrays
By default, all changes made to an array are reset right after execution. 
However, you may want to use arrays to store some data across executions/commands, that has to keep track of all changes among the executions.

In that case [permanent variables](./6.variables.md#permanent) come in handy.

In this example we will create a `!todo` command that will store and display all tasks scheduled.
More specifically, we want it to:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1105873889155895407/1109232936735232100/image.png)

```php
// Initiate a variable with empty array
$initVar[server;todo;]
// Load the array from variable (Using | as separator)
$arrayCreate[$getServerVar[todo];|]
// Push a task to the list
$arrayPush[$message]
// Save the array (Using | as separator)
$setServerVar[todo;$arrayJoin[|]] 
// Format the list to "1. task" (optional)
$arrayMap[value;index]{$index. $value}

// Return the list
TODO:
$arrayJoin[#NL#]
```

Let's add some tasks

<discord-messages>
    <discord-message author=Member role-color=#ffcc9a>
        !todo Wash dishes
    </discord-message>
    <discord-message :bot=true author="Custom Command" role-color="#0099ff" avatar="https://media.discordapp.net/avatars/725721249652670555/781224f90c3b841ba5b40678e032f74a.webp">
        1. Wash dishes
    </discord-message>
    <discord-message author=Member role-color=#ffcc9a>
        !todo Touch the grass
    </discord-message>
    <discord-message :bot=true author="Custom Command" role-color="#0099ff" avatar="https://media.discordapp.net/avatars/725721249652670555/781224f90c3b841ba5b40678e032f74a.webp">
        TODO: <br>
        1. Wash dishes <br>
        2. Touch the grass
    </discord-message>
</discord-messages>

Notice that changes made to the array do not expire after execution.

### 🎉 Congratulations
You've reached the end of this tutorial, but not the end of array capabilities!
There's plenty of functions that make arrays tick, have fun exploring the [Array category](../Text/Array/arrayClear.md)!
