# Server Boost Trigger

## Basic Information
This trigger, will only trigger if someone boosted or removed the boost from your server

## Syntax
the trigger value should be `add/remove`

`add`: for trigger only if someone boosted
`remove`: for trigger only if someone removed the boost

if you leave it blank, it will trigger for both

## Example
### Let's create the server boost trigger command

Notice, that we left trigger value blank, because we want it to trigger for both cases
we will know if user boosted or unboosted with `$isBoosting`

### Output (When boosting)
