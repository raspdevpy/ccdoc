# Discord Rate Limits
Rate Limits prevents misleading usage or abuse of the API. Our Bot receives a lot of requests, that's why we have decided to use our own cooldown system.

## Function Cooldown
Many functions have a **cooldown** — time till next execution is possible for the same data input/user/place (e.g. channel or guild).

The Bot acts differently if a called function is on cooldown: waits for cooldown to pass, then execute; sends an error message; cancels the execution without warning.
::: tip
You can retrieve the cooldown of a function by using the command `!!func fname`.
:::

## Function Limit
The same function with cooldown can only be called **5 times in the code**.<br/>
If Function Limit is reached, bot cancels the execution of the function without warning.

## Execution Limits
The Bot supports up to **5 parallel executions** of the same custom command.

## Execution Cooldown
The same custom command can only be triggered **once in 5 seconds**.
